# Python Implementation of Google's OR-tools Vehicle Routing solution
- Functionality: this code takes a list of physical addresses in CSV format and finds an approximate solution to the multiple traveling salesperson problem (mTSP) with a user-specified number of salespeople. The output of the code is a CSV file containing the optimal routes for each salesperson. It uses the Google Maps API to compute the distance matrix using real-time traffic information.
